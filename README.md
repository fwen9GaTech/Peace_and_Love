Detecting hateful speech in multimodal memes can leverage AI to stop the spread of hatred and improve the experience on social media. The team investigated several start-of-the-art models, such as ViLBERT, VisualBERT, and MMBT Grid. In addition to the baseline models, the team tried different combinations of mixing original and text-removed images for a comparative study of model performance. The team also tried different data augmentation strategies and eventually applied “weak” data augmentation for multimodal pre-trained models and “strong” data augmentation for unimodal pre-trained models. Different ensemble methods were used to improve the accuracy and the ROC-AUC score. The ensembled classification model got a 0.729 accuracy and a 0.779 ROC-AUC score, both were great improvement from Facebook’s baseline model. The text generation method was used to successfully transform the hateful memes into neutral memes.
